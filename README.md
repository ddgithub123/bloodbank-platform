## 🩸 Blood Donation Web Application 

The **Blood Donation Web Application** is a full-stack system developed to simplify and digitize the process of connecting blood donors with those in urgent need. It aims to address the challenges faced in manual donation processes by providing a centralized, real-time platform for donors, recipients, and administrators.

### ✅ Key Objectives:

* Facilitate **easy donor registration** and **profile management**.
* Allow hospitals or recipients to **submit blood requests** based on urgency and blood group.
* Match requests with suitable donors using **smart filtering** (blood group, location, and availability).
* Provide **real-time notifications** via email or in-app alerts to increase response times.
* Enable **administrators to manage requests**, view analytics, and export reports.
* Support **feedback collection** from users post-donation and **generate certificates** as recognition for donor contributions.

### 💡 Core Modules:

* **User Authentication** (Login/Signup with secure access)
* **Request Management** (Create, approve, fulfill blood requests)
* **Donor Matching Algorithm**
* **Notification System** (SMS/Email integration)
* **Admin Dashboard** (View metrics, manage users)
* **Feedback & Certificate Generation**
